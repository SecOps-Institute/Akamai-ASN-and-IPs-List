# Akamai ASN and IP Addresses
A list of all Akamai Servers using the ASN Numbers from RADB Lookups

*Note: This is a beta list as we are currently using only the RIPE RADB Lookup. We have noticed some differences while using the search using Hurricane Electric Lookup and soon we shall update the IP list. Hence we are calling this list as a **NON-EXHAUSTIVE** list as of now.*

## Things to do
1. Make the IP List exhaustive
2. Summarize the networks. Currently they are not summarised and could be having overlapping subnets
